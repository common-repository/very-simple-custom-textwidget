This is a very simple plugin to add a custom text widget in your sidebar.


== Description ==
= About =
This is a very simple plugin to add a custom text widget in your sidebar.

It has the same look as the native text widget, but with extra input fields to set an image and a more info link.

= NOTICE = 
This plugin will be removed from repository. Main reasons are the new native text, image and HTML widget and the small number of active installs.

You can keep using plugin, but without updates and without support from author.

= How to use =
After installation go to Appearance > Widgets and add the custom text widget to your sidebar.

You will notice the extra input fields:

* Image
* Link to post, page or website for more info
* Link label

= Set image =
I recommend using an image from the media library of your website: copy file link and paste this link in relevant input field.

= Set more info link =
You can set a link (URL) to a post, page or website for more info.

And you can label this link, default (translated) label is "More info".

= Question? =
Please take a look at the FAQ section.

= Credits =
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!

Enjoy!


== Installation ==
Please check Description section for installation info.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where is the settingspage? =
Plugin has no settingspage, use the custom text widget to make it work.

= How do I set plugin language? =
Plugin will use the site language, set in Settings > General.

If plugin isn't translated into this language, language fallback will be English.

= Why not use the native text and image widget instead? =
This plugin is developed before the introduction of the new native text and image widget.

But these widgets still have basic functionality.

With this plugin you combine both native widgets into one.

= Can I add multiple custom text widgets? =
Yes, as many as you want.

= Can I add HTML markup? =
Yes, HTML markup is allowed in text field.

Example: `<h3>this is a heading</h3>`
Example: `<strong>this is bold text</strong>`

= How can I make a donation? =
You like my plugin and you're willing to make a donation? Nice! There's a PayPal donate link at my website.

= Question or comment? =
Please open a topic in plugin forum.
